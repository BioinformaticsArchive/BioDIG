#BioDIG Biological Database of Images and Genomes

## What is BioDIG?

BioDIG is a collection of software tools to connect image and genomic data. 
While we are experiencing an explosion in both sequence and image data, we need to 
link these two types of data. Examples include: model organism mutations, cell morphology â€” 
e.g. pathology and cancer and any type of phenotype data that can be imaged, that can be associated 
with one or more genes. Anything from a Blue Whale to a virus, really.

## Can I see an example?
